### About Adorufu

Adorufu is a minecraft mod that assists the player in survival anarchy environments. "Adorufu" is Japanese for "Adolf"

### Installation tutorial

Download the latest release of `Adorufu.jar` from the http://sashadev.me/EmotionalLove/Adorufu/tree/master/releases/ and select the latest version and download the jar, than put it into your `.minecraft/mods` folder. Once you've logged into a world. Type `-bind clickgui <key>` and hit that key to open the ClickGUI, from there you can toggle modules. If you don't know what a module does, you can type `-help module <the name of the module>` and it'll tell you it's purpose. You can do the same with commands using `-help command <name of command>`, and it'll tell you the command's syntax and description.

If you'd like to reposition the HUD elements (like the tps counter), you can open `.minecraft/AdorufuData.yml` in WordPad or TextEdit, and edit the bit that reads like the following:

```
Adorufu:
  gui:
    hud:
      watermark: LT
      hacklist: RB
      coordinates: LB
      saturation: RT
      inventorystats: RT
      horsestats: RT
      fps: LB
      tps: RT
```

`RT` means right-top, `LB` means left-bottom, `RB` means right-bottom, `LT` means left-top. Make sure the game is CLOSED when editing these values.

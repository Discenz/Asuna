# Xdolf 4.x

This is a work in progress. ETA: One week(?)

### About Xdolf

Xdolf began as a Minecraft cheat client based off of x0XP's Adolf client for Minecraft 1.6.x. Originally distributed as a Minecraft version JAR, it recieved negative attention from Mojang, and it eventually stopped being developed. Xdolf 3.x was completely re-written, however there were a lot of bugs, and it was still written into a versions JAR. Xdolf 4.x is written as a Forge mod, and compatible with other Forge mods, and carefully rewritten. Stay tuned for the first release.

### Installation tutorial

Download the latest release of `Xdolf.jar` from the "Releases" tab and drop it into your `.minecraft/mods` folder. Upon launching Minecraft and joining a world, use `-bind clickgui <key>` to bind the GUI, and hit that key to pull up the GUI.
